            <p class="section_15__text mb-0">Ever since our founding, Plenco has been a good employer, 
                supplier and neighbor when it comes to the environment. We have implemented 
                sustainable processes that not only are respectful of our surroundings but make good 
                business sense as well. (Basecamp - 10/07/21 Proofs - About - Environmental Policy)</p>

                pre-date the existence of regulatory bodies such as the Environmental Protection Agency. 
                Environmental stewardship and responsibility have been a part our identity as a company from 
                the start. Nonetheless, Plenco is committed to continuous improvement as it relates to our 
                environmental practices and policies.</p>
